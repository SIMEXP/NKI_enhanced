opt.slice_timing.flag_center      = 0;                       % Set the origin of the volume at the center of mass of a brain mask. This is useful only if the voxel-to-world transformation from the DICOM header has somehow been damaged. This needs to be assessed on the raw images.
opt.slice_timing.flag_skip        = true;                    % Skip the slice timing (0: don't skip, 1 : skip). Note that only the slice timing corretion portion is skipped, not all other effects such as FLAG_CENTER or FLAG_NU_CORRECT

opt.t1_preprocess.nu_correct.arg = '-distance 75'; % Parameter for non-uniformity correction. 200 is a suggested value for 1.5T images, 75 for 3T images. If you find that this stage did not work well, this parameter is usually critical to improve the results.

% Temporal filtering (niak_brick_time_filter)
opt.time_filter.hp = 0.01; % Cut-off frequency for high-pass filtering, or removal of low frequencies (in Hz). A cut-off of -Inf will result in no high-pass filtering.

opt.corsica.flag_skip                = 1;     % Skip CORSICA (0: don't skip, 1 : skip). Even if it is skipped, ICA results will be generated for quality-control purposes. The method is not currently considered to be stable enough for production unless it is manually supervised.

% Spatial smoothing (niak_brick_smooth_vol)
